# AB test load example

We would like to A/B test a number of promotional designs to see which provides the best
conversion rate.

So we need to redirect end users to the different designs, i.e., 50% of people will be shown Design A, 25% shown Design B and 25% shown Design C.

The code needs to be scalable as a single promotion may have upwards of 3 designs to test.

_Notice: Be aware that this is an example code, so you may need to adapt it to your situation_
